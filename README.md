# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Background

This homework challenge was assigned so I could build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. **Note:** The instructor has said that our quiz doesn't need to be related to JS.
